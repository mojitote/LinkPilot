# LinkPilot Design Guidelines

See [docs/design-guidelines.md](mdc:docs/design-guidelines.md) for full details.

- Use **JavaScript only** (no TypeScript) for all files and components.
- All styling must use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes.
- The theme is modern, inspired by LinkedIn blue (`#0A66C2`) and white backgrounds.
- **Component naming:** Use PascalCase for all React components and files.
- **Button styles:** Use unified Tailwind classes for primary and secondary buttons as documented.
- **Layout:** Use consistent container, padding, and shadow classes for a modern, clean look.
- **Responsive:** Use Tailwind's responsive utilities for all layouts.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML and ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
