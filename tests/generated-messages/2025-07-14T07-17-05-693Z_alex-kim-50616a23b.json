As a fellow Computer Science student at UTS with a passion for AI, I believe we have a lot in common.\n\nI've recently been working on a project called LinkPilot, an AI assistant for LinkedIn lead generation built with Next.js, MongoDB, Puppeteer, and the OpenAI API. I'd be thrilled to hear about any projects you're currently working on and discuss potential collaborations in AI + backend development.\n\nLooking forward to connecting with you!\n\nBest regards,\n"
